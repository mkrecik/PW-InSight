## üèõÔ∏èPW InSight

PW InSight is an interactive Android application designed for use inside the Main Building of **Warsaw University of Technology** to get to know the knicks and crannies of this monument. Discover the hidden corners of this historic site and learn about the university‚Äôs rich past by visiting marked Points of Interest. Whether you're a student or a visitor I'm sure you'll be surprised.

### How It Works?
- The app uses Bluetooth to detect beacons placed throughout the building.
- It locates the user by approximating the location from detected beacons.
-  When the user approaches a POI (within 2 meters), a pop-up with a short description appears.
- *Still in development: a text-to-speech feature which will give you a real museum experience if you don't feel like reading or forgot your glasses.*

### Features
- Real-time beacon detection and trilateration-based positioning.
- Pop-ups triggered by proximity to a POI.
